# Analyzing Data With PostgreSQL

Given several CSV files relating to:
* Employees
* Departments
* Salaries
* Job Titles
* Department Managers
* Department Employees

## Data Modeling & Company Entity Relationship Diagram
After evaluating each CSV for data and column headings, the Entity Relationship Diagram was created to show how the data in the CSVs relate to one another. Here we looked at entities, the primary and foreign keys, and the attributes that belong to those entities.

## Data Engineering
After creating the ERD, we created the database schema including the tables with the required primary and foreign keys and other attributes that belong to the tables. Then the data in the CSVs were imported into their respective tables.

## Data Analysis
Using the information in the tables, queries were created to obtain the requested information from the tables.
